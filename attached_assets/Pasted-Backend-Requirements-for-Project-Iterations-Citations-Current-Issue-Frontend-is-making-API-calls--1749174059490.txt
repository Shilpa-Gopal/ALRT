Backend Requirements for Project Iterations & Citations
Current Issue:
Frontend is making API calls to endpoints that don't exist in your Flask backend, causing 404 and 405 errors when users try to View/Edit projects.

Missing Endpoints That Need Implementation:

1. DELETE /api/projects/{id}
Current Status: Returns 405 "Method Not Allowed"
Required: Allow project deletion
Headers: X-User-Id required
Response: {"success": true, "message": "Project deleted successfully"}
2. GET /api/projects/{id}/keywords
Current Status: Returns 404 "Project not found"
Required: Return project keywords and suggestions
Headers: X-User-Id required
Response:
{
  "suggested_keywords": [{"word": string, "score": number}],
  "selected_keywords": {
    "include": [string],
    "exclude": [string]
  }
}
3. GET /api/projects/{id}/citations/filter
Current Status: Frontend calls this but gets no citations
Required: Return citations with relevance scores for the project
Headers: X-User-Id required
Query Params: iteration (optional), is_relevant (optional)
Response:
{
  "citations": [{
    "id": number,
    "title": string,
    "abstract": string,
    "is_relevant": boolean,
    "iteration": number,
    "relevance_score": number
  }]
}
4. GET /api/projects/{id}/labeled-citations
Current Status: Not implemented
Required: Return all labeled citations across iterations
Headers: X-User-Id required
Response: {"labeled_citations": [...]}
5. GET /api/projects/{id}/iterations
Current Status: Not implemented
Required: Return iteration info and metrics
Headers: X-User-Id required
Response:
{
  "current_iteration": number,
  "max_iterations": number,
  "metrics": object
}
What Works Currently:

Authentication endpoints (login/signup)
GET /api/projects (returns real project data)
Basic project creation
Priority Order:

DELETE /api/projects/{id} (highest priority - users can't delete projects)
GET /api/projects/{id}/keywords (breaks Edit functionality)
GET /api/projects/{id}/citations/filter (breaks View functionality)
GET /api/projects/{id}/labeled-citations & iterations (for full workflow)
